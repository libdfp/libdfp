Version 1.0.10

* Added BID support for x86_64 and x86.

* Fixes to avoid external PLT calls to internal supplied symbols.

* Add optimized fabsd[32|64|128], and copysignd[32|64|128] for PowerPC
  with DFP hardware support.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0.9

* Support for powerpc64le has beed added.

* Various fixes for LE build.

* Support for configure with --with-cpu=power8 has been added.

* Fix for isinfd[32|64|128]: it now follow GLIBC convention and returns
  1 for plus infinity and -1 for minus infinity.

* Fix finited result to return a positive argument for any normal
  number.

* New <math.h> macro named issignaling to check for a signaling NaN (sNaN).
  It is based on draft TS 18661.

* New llogbd[32|64|128] implementation to return the logb result as
  long int.

* New roundevend[32|64|128] implementation that rounds its argument to the
  nearest integer value in floating-point format, rounding halfway cases
  to even (that is, to the nearest value whose least significant bit 0),
  regardless of the current rounding direction. 
  It is based on draft 18661-2.

* Add optimized ceild[32|64|128], truncd[32|64|128], floord[32|64|128],
  nearbyintd[32|64|128], roundd[32|64|128], and roundevend[32|64|128]
  for PowerPC with DFP hardware support.

* New quantumd[32|64|128] implementation that compute the quantum of a
  finite argument.
  It is based on draft 18661-2.

* Add optimized quantumd[32|64|128] and samequantumd[32|64|128]
  implementation for PowerPC with DFP hardware support.
