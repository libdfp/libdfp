# See scripts/check-localplt.awk for how this file is processed.
#
# For s390: register_printf_dfp is also allowed
# as R_390_GLOB_DAT in section .rela.dyn
# instead of R_390_JMP_SLOT in section .rela.plt.
# In the former case register_printf_dfp is called via function-pointer
# loaded from GOT, which also can be relocated by dynamic linker.
# A plt-stub is not generated.
# This relocation is done at load-time (and lazy-binding is not possible)!
# 'gcc -O2' leads to R_390_GLOB_DAT, whereas
# 'gcc -O0' or 'gcc -O2 -fno-optimize-sibling-calls' leads to R_390_JMP_SLOT.
